# Cerebro Bot Open Source Translation Files

Cerebro Translations use [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/).
[Follow this format for locale names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)

To add translations follow the current format.
If the locale does not exist as a folder yet then add it.

### Example:
- New folder "en" if English hasn't already been added yet.
- Then copy all files from another translation and go through each individually translating.
